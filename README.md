# Fanfic-Scrap
A Python script for downloading whole threads of fanfiction and original works from the SufficientVelocity and SpaceBattles forums.

Fanfic Scrap is a simple executable python script that's intended mainly for downloading "story only" threads. It will download a whole thread, find the threadmarks, and use those as chapter titles to create an html file for each chapter.

Plans for future versions include eventual bugfixes, adding the possibility to choose the output format of the download (at least epub), and maybe a small GUI. Making it into a plugin for Calibre is not excluded.
